# Backlog

The jot pad. One place the outstanding work lives so neither of us is
re-typing it, and so "what did we decide about X" has an answer.

**How this works.** Don brain-dumps freely — that stays easy, and structuring
the dump is Claude's job, not his. Claude splits it into items here, groups
them, and marks each with two things: how much it hurts, and how sure Claude is
what to build. Anything low-certainty waits for a decision rather than being
guessed at. Updated at the end of every working session.

**Certainty is the axis that has been costing us.** Impact tells us what order
to work in; certainty tells us whether to talk first. High impact + low
certainty is the quadrant where this session lost the most time — the framework
lock got built from a one-line item and had to be undone, and the industry
sections were built onto the configurator, moved, restored twice, and finally
deleted.

Legend — **Hurts:** `blocks` a demo · `daily` friction · `polish`
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Sure:** `high` = go and build it · `low` = needs a decision first

## Decisions

Answered decisions stay here with their answer, so neither of us re-litigates
them. An answer that contradicts something already built says so.

### Answered

**D1 — Gus.** *Framework persona and tone; per-offering capability.*
One Gus everywhere: same name, same voice, one place to edit him. What differs
per offering is what he can **do** on that offering's pages.

> ⚠️ **This inverts what is built.** The `assistant` section currently sits on
> `migration-accelerator::configurator` and holds name, role, button label,
> greeting and input prompt — persona, at the offering level, which is exactly
> backwards. Rework: move persona to the framework, and replace the
> per-offering section with a *capability* declaration (which fields Gus may
> change on that page) rather than copy. See #21.

**D2 — Feedback visibility.** *BD sees their own; the Content Manager sees all.*
`getFeedbackFor` currently returns everyone's notes to everyone. It gets a
`Submitted_By__c = :UserInfo.getUserId()` filter; `getOpenFeedback` stays
unfiltered, because anyone with the Content Manager is a writer.
Also raised: **the feedback card's padding and margins are unfinished** — text
sits too close to the card edge. Folded in as B5.

### Open

**D3 — ANSWERED: A2.** One public site at `/gtm` hosting the configurator and
nothing else; the offerings list and the story live in Lightning, where the BD
is already authenticated. The industry chooser is redundant as a *page* — the
wizard already asks the same question — but stays as the *authoring surface*
where the industry copy lives. Content home is not the same as a rendered page.

Sequence: story viewer (done) → deploy pages to GTM (done) → **Don publishes
and activates GTM** (done — confirmed Live) → guest permissions, Apex repoint,
rewrite the four links (done) → verify (done at the code/record level;
browser screenshot blocked — see Known and accepted) → **Don deactivates GTM
Accelerator** → reseed with permutations.

> Correction: only *activation* (Inactive → Live, one-time) needed Setup UI.
> Routine publish does not — `sf community publish -n <name>` works fine and
> is now the standard step after any ExperienceBundle metadata deploy. A
> metadata deploy only writes the site's draft; nothing is live until
> published. Learned the hard way when the Home redirect deployed clean but
> the real browser still showed blank until publish ran.

One Don action is left: deactivating GTM Accelerator, then reseeding.

*(superseded)* **D3 — the old framing.** Not yet answered. Offerings page + Industry Chooser are
framework; the Configurator belongs to the offering; all three serve from one
Experience site today. Splitting them is the only route to the URL shape you
wanted, because a Salesforce site prefix is a single path segment and cannot be
`/gtm/maaccelerator/`.

**D4 — Requests vs submissions.** Not a decision yet: *"I still need a
walkthrough with you."* Claude explaining it again in prose has failed three
times, so the next attempt is a walkthrough against the real records — one
engagement link, and every row both concepts produced from it. Then decide
whether a submissions list earns a screen. Blocks #16.

**D5 — Self-service link recovery on the bare `/gtm/s/configurator`.** Not a
decision yet. Today a guest with no `?cfgId=` gets a static "this page needs a
link, reach out to your rep" screen (built and live). You floated something
richer: enter your email + the password your rep gave you, resolve to the
right link, and — you weren't sure — maybe a "resend my password" if it's been
forgotten.

The email + password lookup is straightforward and safe to build: no new abuse
surface, since the password is a credential they already hold. The "email me
my password" piece is a materially different feature — a guest-facing form
that sends email based on typed input is a live enumeration and open-relay
target (type any exec's email, learn whether they have an active link; hammer
the endpoint as free outbound mail) and needs its own security pass before it
exists at all, not a quick add.

> **Claude's proposed default:** build the email + password lookup now
> (v1) — matches an existing MA_Saved_Configuration__c by contact email *and*
> its own password together, one guest Apex method, no email sending. Not
> found and expired both render the same existing "reach out to your Rep"
> screen, exactly as you suggested — no separate wrong-password oracle to
> enumerate against. Park "resend to email" as its own item, flagged for
> `security-review` before it's built, not folded into this one.
>
> Needs a yes before it's built — this is guest-facing and auth-adjacent.

**D6 — `MA_`/`Ma` prefix leaks the single-offering assumption.** Raised again
while granting `MA_Assessment_Guest`: it and the Apex classes it grants
(`MaLinkAuthController`, `MaConfigurationStatusController`,
`MaAssessmentRequestController`) are named for Migration Accelerator
specifically, but the mechanism is framework-level — link auth, password
gating, and request submission work identically for any offering, not just
this one. Same pattern likely holds across most `MA_`-prefixed permission
sets, custom objects/fields, and Apex classes in the org.

Not a quick fix: Apex class and permission set API names can't be renamed in
place via metadata — each is create-new, migrate every reference (LWC
imports, other Apex, permission sets, profiles), reassign guest/user
permission sets, then delete the old one. On a live guest-facing site, doing
that carelessly is exactly the kind of thing that breaks password
verification for someone's real link mid-migration. Needs a real inventory
and an ordered plan (probably `spec-author` + `backend-engineer`, done as its
own tracked piece of work) before touching it — not something to fold into
whatever else is in flight when it comes up.

## Ready to build — no decision needed

| # | Item | Hurts | Sure |
|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | **FAQ / help widget** for both apps (#18). Static panel per app, content in the CMS so it's editable. *In progress — dispatched to frontend-engineer.* | polish | high |
| B2 | **Resend an engagement link** — a BD can set and clear a link password but there's no "send this again" action. Real gap found while answering the guest-account question. | daily | high |
| B3 | **Contact-side analytics** — link events now carry `Contact__c` after identity stitching, but nothing on the Contact record shows it. | daily | high |
| B4 | **Delete the retired CMS content** — 17 records, all labelled `RETIRED —`. Select-all → Manage → Delete in the CMS workspace, then the destructive deploy for the five types. Claude cannot do this from here (no Apex delete, no ConnectApi delete, CLI redacts the token). | polish | high |

## Needs Don's eyes before more is built on it

| # | Item | Why |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | **The 72 migrated industry rows** now on the framework's Industry Chooser. Moved but never reviewed. | Everything industry-related now reads from these. If the migration mangled any copy, every configurator inherits it. |
| R2 | **BOA / SC-0012** lost its payload during the `Generated_URL__c` backfill early in the session. Two of eight were recovered from URLs you'd pasted; this one had an empty payload and no field history. Needs re-entering by hand. | Data Claude destroyed. Not recoverable without you. |

## Done this session

Chapters as sections · Gus editable per offering · deals + funnel on the
overview · requests/submissions untangled in the data · container-query preview
fix · deal picker default · interaction sitemap + dwell + identity stitching ·
form resume with partial save · page + field order aligned across all five
pages · industries moved to the framework · offering feedback loop (#25) ·
gtmPageBrowser replacing the story viewer · Configurator's external route
deployed to `/gtm` · `getSiteBaseUrl()` repointed onto `urlPathPrefix`
instead of the site label · guest permission-set parity between the GTM and
GTM Accelerator guest users · the four saved links rewritten to `/gtm` ·
bare `/gtm/s/configurator` (no `?cfgId=`) blocked from guests, visible only
to a signed-in Salesforce user · configurable Home redirect (Custom Label,
editable in Setup without a deploy) · two more dead-code removals
(`OfferingSummary.storyUrl`, the unused `getSiteHomePageUrl` import) ·
B5, feedback card padding.

## Known and accepted

- Experience site URL prefixes are immutable and single-segment. Site *display*
  names can only be changed in Setup.
- Guest User licences allow insert and read on a custom object — never update or
  delete. The form-draft design is shaped around this.
- Chromium in the dev container cannot reach the org through the proxy, so
  visual verification is by mockup and by querying the org, not by screenshot.
